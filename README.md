# Particle Simulator
A simple particle simulator that can simulate electric, magnetic and gravitational forces to point particles.

## Inspiration
I have been learning about all these forces in by 9th and 10th grade and I wanted to put these to a use. So I thought why not build a particle simulator (as I am alread a ✨well established programmer✨).

## Features
- Electrostatic force.
- Gravitational force.
- Simulation speed control.

## TODOS
### Features
- Magnetic force
- 
### UX
- Better UI.
- Editable particles during runtime.
